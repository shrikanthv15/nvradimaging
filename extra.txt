parametric prostate MRI and MRI-ultrasound fusion-guided prostate biopsies. He has an
established track record of translating innovations into standards of clinical care. His research
has resulted in over 30 exhibits at national and international conferences, 15 peer-reviewed
publications, several awards, and a book chapter. Dr. Somwaru is an associate editor and

Dr. Somwaru is active in the design and implementation of longitudinal curricula into diagnostic
radiology residency education. His educational mission is for radiologists to be completely
integrated into clinical practice through competency-based curricula and longitudinal
sequencing, which require engagement between trainees and educators, multidisciplinary and
team-based educational opportunities, and modality and systems-based practice opportunities for
preparation into real-world practice.
Dr. Somwaru has embraced partnership concepts into a transformational style of leadership that
he has learned on local, regional, and national levels to achieve improved communication, which
is integral to the complex environment of interdisciplinary care and team science.
