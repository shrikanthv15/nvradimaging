The Founders: Your credentials serve as a powerful clinical QA metric, highly valuable to both B2B clients and end-patients.

3. Services and Protocols
Our service is structured around a specialized workflow designed for high quality and efficiency.

A. Whole-Body MRI Teleradiology Reading (B2B)
Clinical Governance: We partner with the client's imaging center to ensure the acquisition protocols are high-quality (e.g., 3.0T preferred) and standardized for the whole-body workflow.

Specialized Workflow:

The Brain/Neuro Read: Handled by the Neuro Radiologist (Harvard). Focus on CNS, spine, and vascular structures.

The Body Read: Handled by the Body Imaging Radiologist (Johns Hopkins). Focus on chest, abdomen, pelvis, and MSK system.

This dual-subspecialty review ensures coverage by the most qualified expert for each major organ system, reducing diagnostic blind spots.

Reporting: Standardized, structured reports designed for clarity and rapid turnaround time (TAT). Use of specific templates for incidental findings to guide follow-up recommendations (e.g., "Follow-up MRI in 6 months" vs. "Referral to Surgery").

B. Concierge Patient Consultation (B2C via B2B Contract)
This is the premium, differentiating service and a primary revenue driver.

The Delivery: 30-minute virtual consultation with the interpreting radiologist.

Goals of the Consultation:

Clinical Translation: Explain complex medical findings in clear, concise language.

Anxiety Management: Contextualize incidental findings, emphasizing what is benign and what requires monitoring or action.

Action Plan Generation: Create a clear, evidence-based follow-up plan (e.g., recommend a referral to a specific type of specialist, or suggest a 6-month surveillance scan).

The Patient Report: A simplified, visual Executive Summary is provided to the patient prior to the call, allowing the consultation time to be spent on discussion, not reading.

4. Market Analysis and Target Clientele

That refined pricing structure—$800 for the elite subspecialty reading and $500 for the personalized clinical consultation—is well-justified by your Harvard/Hopkins credentials and sets a premium professional fee (P.F.) of $1,300 per case.

I have updated the Financial Plan section of your business document to reflect this. Below is the updated financial summary, followed by the requested template for your 30-minute concierge consultation session, which reinforces the value of that $500 fee.

💰 Updated Financial Plan: NV Rad Imaging
The service-based model for NV Rad Imaging focuses on high gross margins by leveraging intellectual capital over physical assets.

Category	Detail & Projection
Revenue per Case (Professional Fee)	$1,300 (This is the total fee billed to the B2B client, or paid directly by the patient).
Component Breakdown	Interpretation (Reading Fee): $800 Concierge Consultation Fee: $500
Annual Operating Expenses	Estimated $25,000 - $40,000 per month (depending on administrative salary and technology subscriptions).
Break-Even Analysis	At $1,300 revenue per case, the monthly break-even volume is approximately 58 - 77 cases per month to cover estimated fixed costs of $75,000 - $100,000 (including owner draws, professional insurance, PACS/RIS, and administrative salary).
Scaling Goal	To be profitable, NV Rad Imaging should target a steady volume of 100+ cases per month within the first 18 months, which requires securing 2-3 significant B2B contracts.
📞 Concierge Consultation Session Template ($500 Value)
This structured, 30-minute virtual consultation is the cornerstone of the NV Rad Imaging value proposition, assuring clients that their patients receive responsible, subspecialty-guided care.

Session Goal: Responsible Triage and Action Planning
Time: 30 minutes (Video Conference) Personnel: The interpreting Radiologist (Dr. Viswanadhan or Dr. Somwaru) and the Patient. Pre-requisites:

Patient has completed the scan.

NV Rad Imaging has finalized the formal clinical report and generated the visual Layperson Executive Summary.

The summary has been sent to the patient 24 hours prior to the consultation to maximize time efficiency.

Time Allotment	Phase	Radiologist Objectives & Script Guidance
0 - 5 min	I. Introduction & Agenda	Objective: Establish rapport, confirm identity, manage expectations, and set the agenda. Script: "Hello, I’m Dr. [Viswanadhan/Somwaru]. I reviewed your Whole-Body MRI. My goal today is to walk you through the results, focus on anything important, and provide you with a clear, actionable plan for your primary care doctor. We have 30 minutes. Are you ready to begin?"
5 - 15 min	II. The "All Clear" (The Win)	Objective: Deliver the most important finding first—the absence of major, actionable disease. Script (If Negative): "The excellent news is that your scan is overwhelmingly unremarkable. Specifically, we see no evidence of aggressive tumors or acute vascular disease in the 13-14 organ systems we evaluated." Focus (If Positive): Immediately address the single most significant finding, providing initial context (e.g., "We found an early-stage nodule that requires attention, but everything else is clear.").
15 - 20 min	III. Incidental Findings (The Triage)	Objective: Responsibly manage common, benign findings to mitigate anxiety (e.g., cysts, mild degenerative changes). Script: "Now, let's discuss the smaller observations, which we call incidental findings. These are common and usually benign. For example, you have a few small cysts on your kidneys. Based on our clinical guidelines, these require no action."
20 - 25 min	IV. The Action Plan (The Value)	Objective: Clearly define the required follow-up steps for any actionable findings (the core of the $500 value). Script: "For the [finding, e.g., small liver hemangioma], our subspecialty recommendation is surveillance. We recommend [action, e.g., a dedicated follow-up MRI in six months], not a biopsy, to confirm stability. This specific recommendation is detailed in your report."
25 - 30 min	V. Q&A and Close	Objective: Address final patient questions and reinforce the role of the Primary Care Physician (PCP). Script: "Do you have any final questions for me? Remember, the full report is being sent to your doctor, who will manage the logistics of the follow-up plan we just discussed. Thank you for your proactive approach to your health."
We will also use AI to enhance image protocols, quality, and provide AI enabled translation of findings for patients in lay terms

That is a crucial and forward-thinking addition. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into your workflow significantly enhances the value proposition of NV Rad Imaging by directly addressing the need for efficiency, consistency, and patient-friendly communication.

I have updated the business plan sections to reflect the integration of AI into your protocols and concierge service, solidifying your position as a technologically advanced and clinically responsible provider.
