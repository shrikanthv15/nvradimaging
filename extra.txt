4. Addressing Skepticism (The Balanced View)
Many in the traditional medical community express skepticism about whole-body screening for average-risk, asymptomatic individuals, citing potential "incidentalomas" (minor findings that lead to unnecessary, expensive, and stressful follow-ups). Your content should proactively address this to build trust:

> Our Commitment to Responsible Screening:

We understand the concerns around incidental findings. Our board-certified teleradiologists are specifically trained in whole-body screening protocols to provide the highest-quality interpretations, focusing on clinically significant findings that impact long-term health. Every result is followed by a consultation to clarify findings and establish a clear, responsible path forward, minimizing unnecessary stress and procedures.
